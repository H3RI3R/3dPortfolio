          Hi, I’m Ritik Soni, a Java Backend / Full Stack Developer with professional
          experience building secure, scalable, and production-ready web applications.
          I specialize in backend development using Java, Spring Boot, and RESTful APIs,
          with a strong focus on clean architecture, performance, and reliability.
          <br /><br />
          I have worked on real-world business applications such as School ERP systems,
          Hotel Management platforms, and multi-panel admin systems involving
          authentication, database-driven workflows, and role-based access control.
          I enjoy solving complex backend problems, optimizing system performance,
          and writing clean, maintainable code.
